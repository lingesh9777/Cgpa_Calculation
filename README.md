# CGPA Calculator

The CGPA Calculator is a C++ program designed to calculate the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for a student. It organizes courses across multiple semesters, accepts grades for each course, and computes both the semester GPA (SGPA) and overall CGPA.

## Project Overview

This CGPA Calculator stores course information, such as course code, course name, and credit hours, for each semester in a nested vector structure. It calculates the SGPA for each semester based on user-provided grades, and then uses these values to determine the overall CGPA.

## Project Structure

The main classes in the project are:

### 1. Course

Represents a single course with:
- course_code: The unique identifier for the course.
- course_name: The name of the course.
- credit: The number of credits assigned to the course.

### 2. Semester

Represents a semester containing multiple Course objects. This class:
- Stores a list of courses in the semester.
- Provides a method to display all courses and credits for the semester.


### 3. Departments

Represents a department containing multiple Semester objects. This class:
- Stores all semesters in a department.
- Displays all courses and credits across semesters.


### 4. Cgpa

Calculates the cumulative GPA by combining SGPAs across multiple semesters. This class:
- Calculates the Semester GPA based on grades entered for each course.
- Prompts the user to continue calculating for subsequent semesters.
- Computes the final CGPA based on the total credits and weighted grade points.

## Features

- *Course Management*: Stores and organizes course information by semester.
- *SGPA Calculation*: Computes the SGPA for individual semesters.
- *CGPA Calculation*: Calculates the overall CGPA across semesters.
- *Modular Structure*: Easily extensible to add more courses, semesters, or departments.

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language*: C++ (Standard Library)
- *Headers*: Custom headers for Course, Semester, Departments, Sgpa, and Cgpa.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/lingesh9777/Cgpa_Calculation.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd CGPA-Calculator
   
3. Compile the program:
   bash
   g++ main.cpp -o cgpa_calculator
   
4. Run the program:
   bash
   ./cgpa_calculator
   

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. The program will display each course and prompt you to enter a grade.
3. Enter the grade for each course (e.g., O, A+, A, B+).
4. After each semester, choose whether to continue to the next semester.
5. At the end, the program displays the calculated CGPA.
